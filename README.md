# Similarity Metrics for Research

In today's data-driven research landscape, quantifying the similarity or difference between datasets is essential for various applications. Datasets come in diverse forms, including scalar values, 1-dimensional vectors, 2-dimensional matrices, and n-dimensional tensors. To enable this comparison, various mathematical measures are employed to assess the similarity or dissimilarity (distance) between these data structures.

## Overview

This repository provides a collection of similarity and distance metrics designed to address a wide range of data types. These metrics help researchers, data scientists, and engineers analyze, compare, and interpret their data effectively. Whether you are working with numerical data, text, images, or any other type of information, these metrics offer versatile solutions for your research needs.

## Key Distance Metrics

Here are some common distance metrics provided by this repository:

1. **L1-Norm (Manhattan Distance):**
   - Formula: $\sum{|X_i - Y_i|}$
   - Description: Computes the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding data points. It is related to the mean absolute error.

2. **L2-Norm (Euclidean Distance):**
   - Formula: $\sqrt{\sum{(X_i^2 - Y_i^2)}}$
   - Description: Calculates the square root of the sum of squared differences between corresponding data points. This is related to the root mean squared error.

3. **Lâˆž-Norm (Chebyshev Distance):**
   - Formula: Max(|$X_i - Y_i$|)
   - Description: Measures the maximum distance between the two datasets.
